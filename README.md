# SentiLens - Uncover reviews' hidden sentiment

## THE BIG IDEA:

Employing aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) to extract valuable feature insights from e-commerce product reviews, thereby empowering consumers to make more informed purchasing decisions and enhancing their overall user experience on the platform.

Utilizing manually annotated reviews for aspect sentiment analysis to extract aspects and predict sentiments from reviews. This enables consumers to obtain a condensed overview of sentiments related to various product features, eliminating the need to delve into an extensive array of reviews. As a result, the decision-making process becomes more streamlined and user-friendly.



## THE USER:

The primary beneficiaries of this project encompass two main groups:

**Consumers**:

Who experiences these problems? E-commerce consumers who seek to make well-informed purchasing decisions.

How would they benefit? Consumers often face the challenge of sifting through a multitude of reviews to make a confident purchase. By employing ABSA, this initiative furnishes consumers with a concise and organized overview of sentiment across various product aspects, extracted from fellow consumers’ reviews, enabling them to make more informed decisions efficiently. This translates to a more gratifying shopping experience, reduced uncertainty, and an increased likelihood of making purchases that align with their preferences and needs. Consequently, customers gain a comprehensive understanding of the products they purchase, minimizing the likelihood of encountering unexpected characteristics and subsequently reducing the rate of product returns.

**Sellers & Platform**:

Who experiences these problems? E-commerce platforms and sellers aiming to enhance their sales, reduce return costs, and uphold customer satisfaction.

How would they benefit? E-commerce platforms grapple with challenges such as incomplete product descriptions and limited inventories, hindering their ability to attract customers and minimize returns. By integrating ABSA, the outcomes of this project can assist platforms in refining product descriptions based on identified consumer preferences and concerns. This leads to an enriched online marketplace experience, higher sales conversion rates. Additionally, the enhanced knowledge gained by customers about their purchases directly contributes to fewer unexpected characteristics, resulting in a decreased rate of product returns.


## THE IMPACT: 

The anticipated impact of our project extends both to societal and business dimensions, with quantifiable benefits that directly address critical challenges in the e-commerce landscape:

**Business Value**:

Increased Profitability: Our project aims to increase e-commerce sales and lower return rates. 
According to CNBC, the online purchase return rate in 2021 was 21%, which represents a substantial financial burden for e-commerce platforms. By empowering consumers to make more informed purchasing decisions through our ABSA, we anticipate a substantial reduction in returns. For instance, if our approach reduces the return rate by just 5%, this could lead to potential savings of over $20 billion at Amazon, based on Amazon’s 2021 net sales revenue.

Improved Customer Experience: With reviews being a top influence on consumer behavior and purchasing decisions  where 77% of consumers reported consistently or frequently consult reviews prior to purchases, our project directly addresses the consumer frustration arising from irrelevant search results and time-consuming navigation through extensive review content.  Based on a survey, 60% of shoppers get annoyed by searches that don't match what they're looking for, and almost half (47%) say it takes too long to find what they want, while 41% struggle to find the exact thing they need. By enhancing the product descriptions and facilitating better understanding of reviews, consumers can more efficiently locate and acquire the exact products they desire. This leads to heightened customer satisfaction and increased loyalty.

Logistics Cost Reduction: E-commerce giants like Amazon spend significant resources on logistics, with returns being a substantial contributor to these costs. By leveraging our approach to minimize returns, platforms can potentially save a substantial portion of their logistics expenses. For instance, a 5% reduction in return-related logistics costs could translate to savings of approximately $7.6 billion, based on Amazon's 2021 logistics spending.

**Societal Value**:

Reduced landfill waste: The prevalence of returned products contributing to landfill waste is a concerning environmental issue. By implementing our ABSA approach to minimize returns, the amount of unsellable items destined for landfills can be significantly reduced. This translates into a positive ecological impact by curbing unnecessary waste production.

Decreased CO2 Footprint: Reverse delivery processes, required for returned items, contribute to higher carbon emissions due to transportation. With a decrease in product returns through our approach, the need for reverse logistics and subsequent carbon emissions can be mitigated, resulting in a tangible reduction in CO2 footprint.
